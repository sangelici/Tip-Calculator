## Continued Development

While the fundamental pieces of the app have been accomplished (ðŸŽ‰), there are some future adjustments and additions I would like to add to enhance the experience for the User!

- Implement a Vemno/Cashapp third party connection so users can take the monetary data from the calculator and submit a payment request through this type of service to add further usability to the tip splitter app.
- 
- Add ability to change the color scheme (EX: Seafoam / Rainbow / Petal ). This would be represented as indivisual buttons or as a dropdown with options in a header/footer that the user can switch back and forth between based on personal preference.
